<p>The Society for Early English &amp; Norse Electronic Texts (SEENET) is a nonprofit scholarly organization dedicated to producing high-quality digital documentary and critical editions of medieval texts. Founded in the early 1990s by Professor Hoyt Duggan at the University of Virginia, SEENET's technical infrastructure was developed at UVA's Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities. Between 2000 and 2011, the Society published its texts in CD-ROM format in conjunction with the University of Michigan Press and Boydell &amp; Brewer. Since 2012, we have transitioned to a web-only publishing platform, providing open-access electronic texts of new and backlist editions at no cost to the end user. Please refer to the <a href="{% link publications.html %}">publications list</a> for information on the availability of current and forthcoming SEENET editions.</p>
