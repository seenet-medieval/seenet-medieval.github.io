            <h1><it>In Memoriam</it>: Hoyt Duggan</h1>
            <article>
<p>Hoyt Duggan, known as Dug to all his friends, passed away on April 8, 2019, a few days
after his 81 st birthday, following a long illness. He will be remembered most particularly for
establishing and directing the Piers Plowman Electronic Archive. He was an early enthusiast
for electronic texts, and at the 1991 Medieval Congress at Kalamazoo he assembled a small
team and set it to work on an edition of the eccentric text of Langland’s poem in Corpus
Christi College, Oxford, MS 201. Despite numerous technological problems and editorial
issues, the edition was published on CD-ROM in 1999, the first of a series of editions of the
B Version. 1 He generously credited the editorial work to the whole team, though it was
mainly his own and that of Robert Adams. For this and future editions Gail Duggan headed a
team of transcribers, and more editors were drawn into the net by Dug’s enthusiasm and with
his constant support and advice. When in 2012 the time came for him to pass on the
directorship, he made sure that the project, now publishing on the internet, was in safe hands
and had a secure future.2</p>
<p>He and I had been brought together by a mutual interest in the marvellous alliterative poem
The Wars of Alexander, on which we corresponded for some years before we actually met.
We spent a decade editing the poem, the work slowed partly by the tardiness of transatlantic
snail-mail, and partly by each of us enthusiastically retreating to entrenched positions which
we defended passionately; but in the end, as we explained in the introduction to the edition,
we agreed on almost all decisions, and recorded those differences which remained
unresolved. 3 It was a fascinating journey for both of us. In order to determine what metrical
constraints governed the composition of alliterative verse, Dug constructed a corpus of nearly
13,000 lines of alliterative verse which he parsed and analysed metrically, and then used the
computer to sort into syntactic and rhythmic patterns. The result was a series of ground-
breaking studies on alliterative metre, beginning with ‘The Shape of the B-Verse in Middle
English Alliterative Poetry’. 4 A couple of studies focused on the metre of Piers Plowman, in
which Dug argued that Langland’s practice was, surprisingly, as rule-governed as that of
other alliterative poets. His later work on the Archive convinced him that he had been wrong,
and he wrote a powerful article admitting his change of mind and the consequences of that for
an editor of the poem. 5 It demonstrated an intellectual honesty which was entirely
characteristic of him. He was a profoundly serious scholar and at the same time a witty and
generous friend.</p>

<p>In addition to his considerable scholarly output, Dug was a dedicated and beloved teacher and
mentor. He taught in the English Department at the University of Virginia from 1968 until his
retirement in 2007. During this time, the department’s reputation grew to international
prominence, with medieval literature acknowledged as one of several areas of particular
strength. Dug’s high standards for himself and his students and his emphasis on mentoring
and professionalization were instrumental in building the strong reputation in early British
literature that the department still enjoys. Today Dug’s former students may be found on the
faculties of numerous universities throughout the U.S. He is remembered as a selfless and
tireless advocate, a friend and teacher always willing to go the extra mile to ensure that his
students were able to succeed. In 2013, as a mark of their affection and their admiration,
Dug’s friends and ex-students contributed to a festschrift in his honour: Yee? Baw For Bokes,
            ed. Michael Calabrese and Stephen H. A. Shepherd (Los Angeles CA).</p>

<p>I first met Dug as an undergraduate student in one of his medieval literature seminars. I
remember well a response I received that semester to an email, addressed “Dear Professor
Duggan,” to request a meeting. The reply came back quickly: “Dear Tim, My friends call me
Dug. How about lunch?” At the time I knew that I admired the person who stood in front of
the class, the scholar who had such an easy command of such difficult texts. And I knew that
he was a model for a life that I was interested in leading. But I had no idea just how much of
a model and mentor this man would become. That brief email exchange meant something to
me then as it does now – it felt like my entrée into the world of scholarship, and indeed in
many ways that is what it turned out to be. And in so many ways it encapsulates what Dug
was about: It was warm and welcoming. It showed no interest in hierarchies or formalities,
but showed instead interest in a person and his ideas. And it is a good example of why Dug
built such close and productive relationships with so many students over his decades of
            teaching.</p>

                        The <span class="title">Piers Plowman Electronic Archive</span>, a
            collaborative open-access project, presents the rich textual tradition
                        of <span class="title">Piers Plowman</span>, a fourteenth-century
                        allegorical dream vision attributed to William Langland. Three distinct
                        versions of the poem (<span class="version">A</span>, <span
                        class="version">B</span>, and <span class="version">C</span>)
                        survive in more than fifty unique manuscripts, none in Langland's own
                        hand. The digital format of this project enables instructors, students,
                        and researchers to explore late medieval and manuscript culture through
                        the many variations of <span class="title">Piers Plowman</span>. </div>
