	<h1><a href="http://piers.chass.ncsu.edu">Piers Plowman Electronic
                                Archive</a></h2>
        <div class="descr">
            <span class="title">The Piers Plowman Electronic Archive</span>, a
	    collaborative open-access project, presents the rich textual tradition
            of <span class="title">Piers Plowman</span>, a fourteenth-century
            allegorical dream vision attributed to William Langland. Three distinct
            versions of the poem (<span class="version">A</span>, <span
                class="version">B</span>, and <span class="version">C</span>)
            survive in more than fifty unique manuscripts, none in Langland's own
            hand. The digital format of this project enables instructors, students,
            and researchers to explore late medieval and manuscript culture through
            the many variations of <span class="title">Piers Plowman</span>. </div>
